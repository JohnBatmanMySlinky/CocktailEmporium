# Welcome to John's Cocktail Emporium

## Core script here is `cocktail_parser.py` a script to parse cocktail recipes
## With this script we can scrap several sites like `bing_images/` or `libor_and_co` or `/r/cocktails` or `thecocktaildb`. 
## Our scraping serves 2 purposes:
    1. Collect recipes
    2. Download images to train model to predict type of cocktail from an image of the cocktail
